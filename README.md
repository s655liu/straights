This is a game I created for the final project of CS 246 (ObjectOriented Programming) using C++. The game status, instructions, and commands are displayed through the command line. due to regulation policies, I will not display any implementatin code. 
Instructions: Lanuch the game on the command line with any integer as the command line argument that indicates the seed for shuffling cards.(ie. ./straights 1 )
The game will have 4 players, each dealt 13 cards from a regular shuffled deck without jokers.
